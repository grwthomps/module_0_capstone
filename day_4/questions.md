## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method?

    It allows you to run the an operation as many times as needed without having
    to write it out every time. Further, it allows you to plug different values
    into the operation without having to write out the operation for each different
    value.

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.

    ```
    def hello
      p "Sam I am"
    end
    ```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.

    ```
    def hello_someone(name)
      p "#{name} I am"
    end
    ```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?

    ```
    hello_someone("Graham") #used my name as an example
    ```

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby?

    None that I can think of.
